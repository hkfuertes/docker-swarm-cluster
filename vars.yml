# The variables below are for a Common Cathode RGB led.
# The red led pin is connected to GPIO22
# The green led pin is connected to GPIO27
# The blue pin is connected to GPIO17
# In case you have a Common Anode RGB led change ledOn to '0' and ledOff to '1'
red:
  ledOn: echo '1' > /sys/class/gpio/gpio22/value
  ledOff: echo '0' > /sys/class/gpio/gpio22/value

green:
  ledOn: echo '1' > /sys/class/gpio/gpio27/value
  ledOff: echo '0' > /sys/class/gpio/gpio27/value

blue:
  ledOn: echo '1' > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value
  ledOff: echo '0' > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value
